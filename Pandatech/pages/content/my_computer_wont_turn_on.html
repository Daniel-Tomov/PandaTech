				<p>To troubleshoot power related issues, follow the steps below.
<br>A. Make sure the computer is plugged into a working power outlet.
<br>B. If your computer has a power switch on the back (it is usually located where you plug in the power
cable), flip the switch into "ON" position.
<br>C. Try turning the computer on by pressing the power button. Listen for any sound from the fans inside
and look for any messages on the monitor's screen. If you hear the fans inside but the screen is black,
verify the monitor is turned on and the cable between the computer and the monitor is connected
properly.
<br>D. If there is no sound from the fans inside follow the steps below</p>
<p>1. Disconnect the power cable and press and hold the power button for 10 seconds.
<br>2. Disconnect every cable (mouse, keyboard, VGA, DVI, HDMI, speakers, microphone, web
camera, etc.).
<br>3. Place the computer's tower on a flat surface. Open the computer case by either unscrewing the
screws on the back or using the latch on one side panel to take it off (or follow the instructions
specific for your case). You must discharge any static electricity from your body by touching a
grounded metal part of the case prior touching anything inside the computer! The static
electricity may damage the internal parts (motherboard, processor, memory chips, video card,
etc.)
<br>4. Verify the memory chips are properly seated/locked in their slots and re-seat them if necessary.
<br>5. Verify the video card (if your computer has a separate video card) is inserted securely into its
slot.
<br>6. Verify the cell type battery, which keeps the internal clock, is good. If not, replace it with the
same type and model.
<br>7. Verify the biggest connector from the power supply is properly plugged in and secured to the
motherboard.
<br>8. Remove any recently installed hardware (sound card, card reader, WI-FI card, etc.).
<br>9. Try turning on the computer with only the memory chips inserted, video card (if separate)
inserted, keyboard and mouse plugged in and monitor connected. If you see any messages on
the screen, power off the computer.
<br>10. Then start adding one component at a time - hard drive, sound card, WI-FI card, web camera,
USB devices - after following step one and verify the computer turns on normally and boots the
operating system. If there is a faulty component and the computer won't turn on after adding it,
replace that component and confirm normal powering on and booting the operating system.
<br>11. If the computer still doesn't turn on seek professional computer service (like from me) for further
troubleshooting and repair.</p>
