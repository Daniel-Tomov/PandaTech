				There are two main reasons for the operating system not booting – either failed hardware or a
software problem. This guide covers some common hardware issues.
<ol>
<li>Verify your memory module(s) are good by replacing them with same type and size and try
booting the operating system. They must be seated properly in their slots.</li><li>While your computer starts, try accessing the BIOS or Setup options. This is usually done by
pressing one of the F keys (F2, F5 or specific to your computer). Once in the BIOS (or Setup)
options, confirm the correct amount of memory is recognized. Then use the arrow keys to
navigate to the tab that shows “Boot Options and devices”.</li><li>Check that the hard drive is being recognized by the computer. If it is, continue to step 6, if it is
not recognized by the computer, go to step 4. Exit the BIOS (or Setup) options.</li><li>Turn off the computer by holding the power button. Disconnect the power cable, press and hold
the power button for 10 seconds. Discharge yourself from any static electricity by touching a
grounded metal case.</li><li>Open the computer case by either unscrewing the hand screws on the back or using the latch on
one side of the computer to take off the side panel. Locate the hard drive which should be
connected to the power supply and the motherboard. Once the hard drive is located, make sure
both cables are snug into their designated places. Try powering on the computer and certify it
boots into the operating system. If it doesn't, go to step 7. Since the case is open, make sure the
fans and motherboard are free from any dust and clean them if needed with pressurized air.
Make sure the processor, motherboard or video card are not overheating.</li><li>6. Turn off the computer by holding the power button. Turn it back on and if a screen pops up
indicating “Windows didn't start properly”, the computer should automatically repair itself and
boot to Windows. If it doesn't you may have to “repair it” by following the prompts. If it still
doesn't boot go to step 7.</li><li>If the operating system doesn't start, you may have a software problem and you need
professional service (like from me).</li>
